Professor Uhe

IS445 -Data Visualization

Final Project

Biggest takeaway from this class:

One of the biggest takeaways from this class was learning how to effectively analyze the characteristics of data visualizations and how to create them myself. Through the weekly data visualization projects, I gained a solid understanding of its function and impact. I believe I now have the skill to transform complex data sets into a more intuitive graphs and charts, which can be very useful in today's data-driven world.


Things Professor Uhe could improve on as a teacher:

I really enjoyed taking this class and i like the variety of topics we covered. However, I did notice that a few classes were canceled during the semester, which somewhat affects the continuity of the course. Perhaps in future classes, there could be additional resources available for students to look at on their own.
